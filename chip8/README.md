# CHIP-8

If you have never heard about CHIP-8, please [allow yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

I had never thought of even looking at what are actually the instructions of CHIP-8 until I got myself trying to make something like CHIP-8. Once I looked, I liked a lot and wanted to try make one myself.

This implementation follows the Cogwood's CHIP-8 Technical Reference somewhere around this file. During the process I did take some poetic licence to play a little bit with the properties of such an ingenious machine :)
