    <h1>Hello, friend!</h1>
    <p>
      I'm experimenting with <em>very smol</em> programming languages that are both fully
      translatable to the physical world and don't have written language involved.
      Why? The short answer is curiosity, the long answer is I don't know how to
      explain yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following versions are made to be translated to a tiny device (think of an Arduino).
      Because of that the screen is minimal and the input is very reduced. On the other hand,
      yeah, the interface might look confusing in the beginning.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./v2/">V2 (8x8 screen)</a></li>
      <li><a href="./v3/">V3 (16x16 screen)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Here is a video of me playing on the <a href="./v3/">V3</a> so you can try to guess how it works.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you don't get it just by looking at it, here are some words:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the arrow keys on your keyboard or click on the "dpad" to move the cursor</li>
      <li>There are 3 action buttons and you can trigger them with "Z", "X" and "C"</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Z: Stamp or select</li>
        <li>X: Erase</li>
        <li>C: Toggle between editing and playing program</li>
      </ul>
      <li>If you "walk out" the screen in any direction you will switch between the stage and the editor</li>
      <li>The first line (green and brown) of the editor are slots for <strong>events</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>First event is the "clock tick". Rules in this event will run all the time</li>
        <li>The follow events are keyboard events in this order: up, right, down, left, Z and X</li>
        <li>The last one does nothing (up to you hack that)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The second line on the editor (blue) are 16 slots for rules</li>
      <li>The next two lines are the color palette</li>
      <li>
        Down on the editor are two 3x3 matrix that work as the rule editor. The
        left matrix is the "WHEN". Once the pattern you draw there is found on
        the stage it will trigger the "THEN". Notice that the "black" color is
        different than "no color". When there is no color, that pixel will be
        ignored in the rule matching.
      </li>
      <li>Very important: Only rules with pixels on the center will be executed</li>
    </ul>
